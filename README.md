## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

The theme brief for the January 2022 Hackathon was to rethink solutions to help build an iniative to improve different aspects of mental health and well-being in 2022.

The judging criteria:

* Provides a clear and substantial value to the user. 
* Uses an original or innovative idea, design or implementation.
* Has well structured and completed documentation (README and wireframes).
* Is well planned and executed using GitHub projects.
* Focus is realistic and has an overall sense of completeness. 

#### Key information for the site

We discussed several ideas for our project and decided to create a site that would allow the user to record their emotional state daily by choosing the emoji that best depicts how they are feeling. The user would also be able to add a journal entry to expand on their choice of emoji and to note anything they feel is having an effect on their mental health. 

Users would then be able to view their previous emojis on a calendar which would allow them to track their well-being. It would also be a useful tool to be able to show to professionals should the user decide to seek further help. When the user selects an emoji logged in the calendar they would then be shown their journal entry for that day. 

As this would be quite personal information it was important that the user be able to make a profile to keep this information private. By registering a profile the user would then be able to utilise the calendar feature.

When a user selects their emoji we will then provide a personalised recommendation for them based off of the selection they have made. So for example if a user is feeling sad they may be recommended a funny video clip or a positive affirmation, if they are feeling stressed they may receive a video on breathing techniques used to relax or a fun game to play to allow them to destress. 

### User Stories

1. As a user I want to be able to easily find out what the site does.
2. As a user I want to ensure that my personal information (login details and feelings log) will be kept secure and private.
3. As a user I want to be able to choose an appropriate emoticon to select as my emotional status for that day.
4. As a user I would like to be able to add additional notes to my emoticon to allow me to express my state of mind.
5. As a user I want to be able to view my previous emoticons and notes over a selected time frame to get an overview of my mental health.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme for the Website](static/documents/colourscheme.png)

We researched colour theory and colour psychology to find what colour palettes may be beneficial to someone who may be struggling with their mental health. We discovered that light blues are associated with peace, sincerity and gentleness. Darker blues are representative of power, strength and dependability. Greens are associated with growth and have a calming presence.  

We feel that this colour palette has a nice balance between the blues and greens to promote calm and peacefulness on the site. The choice of green also ties in with the use of the colour green in the mental health awareness ribbon.

### Typography

We have used sans-serif as our font.

### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Features

The website is comprised of …

* All Pages on the website have:

* Future Implementations.
  * In future implementations we would like to provide the option for a user to be able to change their password or choose to delete their account completely. Due to the time constraints of the Hackathon, this was not a feature required to reach a minimum viable project.

### Accessibility

We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. We utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we went along.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

### PEP8online Python Validator

### Responsiveness

Add in screenshots/gifs of responsiveness.

### Compatibility

Add in screenshots of compatibility.

### Solved Bugs

### Known Bugs

### Testing User Stories

* First Time Visitors

* Returning Visitors

* Frequent Visitors

### Lighthouse

We used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow us to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Full Testing

To fully test my website we performed the following testing using a number of browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Brave) and devices (Macbook Pro 14 inch, iPhone 13 pro, …).

We also went through each page using Google Chrome developer tools to ensure that they responsive on all different screen sizes.
