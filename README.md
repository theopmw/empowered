## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

#### Key information for the site

### User Stories

1. As a user I want to be able to easily find out what the site does.
2. As a user I want to ensure that my personal information (login details and feelings log) will be kept secure and private.
3. As a user I want to be able to choose an appropriate emoticon to select as my emotional status for that day.
4. As a user I would like to be able to add additional notes to my emoticon to allow me to express my state of mind.
5. As a user I want to be able to view my previous emoticons and notes over a selected time frame to get an overview of my mental health.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme for the Website](static/documents/colourscheme.png)

We researched colour theory and colour psychology to find what colour palettes may be beneficial to someone who may be struggling with their mental health. We discovered that light blues are associated with peace, sincerity and gentleness. Darker blues are representative of power, strength and dependability. Greens are associated with growth and have a calming presence.  

We feel that this colour palette has a nice balance between the blues and greens to promote calm and peacefulness on the site. The choice of green also ties in with the use of the colour green in the mental health awareness ribbon.

### Accessibility

We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
