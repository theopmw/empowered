<h2>About Us</h2>

<h3>What is Empower?</h3>
<p>Empower is a site that allows you to log your emotional state every day. You can also choose to add a journal entry 
    which allows you to expand on why you have chosen your selected emoji.</p>

<h3>Why should I use Empower?</h3>
<p>Our emotional health is a very important part of our overall health. By becoming more aware of our 
    emotions can help us talk about our feelings, avoid or resolve conflicts in our lives better and help us to 
    move past difficult feelings. Empower allows you to take a moment out of each day to check in and log your emotions. 
    You are then able to track your emotional health over a period of time using the calendar function in your profile. 
    The calendar feature can also be used to provide evidence of your emotional health should you need to seek help from 
    professionals.</p>

<h3>Can anyone else see my information?</h3>
<p>No. Your privacy is very important to us. In order to log your emotional health you will need to register with the 
    Empower site. This allows you to keep all your information confidential.</p>
